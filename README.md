# Classification of disaster tweets <br/>

Main aim of this project was to classify the tweet, whether it is real or fake using various machine learning models. <br/>
Here, my approach was to first perform some basic NLP techniques to get input data in the required format for modelling.
These techniques involves-
-Tokenization
-Remove stopwords
-Lemmatization
-Vectorization
