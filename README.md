# Classification of disaster tweets <br/>

Main aim of this project was to classify the tweet, whether it is real or fake using various machine learning models. <br/>
Here, my approach was to first perform some basic NLP techniques to get input data in the required format for modelling.<br/>
These techniques involves-
1.Tokenization
2.Remove stopwords
3.Lemmatization
4.Vectorization
